# .agent Directory

This directory contains AI agent tasks, documentation, prompts, and experimental configurations for the Hospitality AI SDK project.

## Structure

- **tasks/** - Active and completed tasks for AI agents
- **docs/** - Technical documentation and architectural decisions
- **prompts/** - Reusable prompts for various AI use cases
- **experiments/** - Experimental configurations and results

## Purpose

This folder serves as the central hub for:
1. Tracking AI-related development tasks
2. Documenting approaches and methodologies
3. Storing prompt templates for different hospitality scenarios
4. Recording experimental results to guide future decisions

## Philosophy

This project embraces a **cost-effective, sustainability-first approach** to AI in hospitality:

- Mix of LLM and traditional algorithms
- Local-first processing where possible
- Pragmatic solutions over perfect ones
- Focus on experimentation and iteration
- Document what works and what doesn't
