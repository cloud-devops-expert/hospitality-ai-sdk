# Zero-Shot Classification - Intelligent Request Routing

## Overview

Automated classification and routing of guest requests using zero-shot ML (BART-large-mnli). Instantly categorize requests into ANY categories without training data, enabling fast department routing and priority triage.

## ROI Summary

**Monthly Savings: $280**
- Faster Request Routing: $150/month (5 hours/week saved on manual routing)
- Reduced Misdirected Requests: $80/month (60% fewer delays from wrong department)
- Staff Efficiency: $50/month (automated categorization)

**Annual Savings: $3,360**

**System Cost: $0/month** (local inference, no API fees)

## Business Problem

**Current State (Manual Routing)**:
- Staff manually read and route 200-300 guest requests/day (emails, chat, phone notes)
- Average 2-3 minutes per request to understand intent and assign department
- 20-30% of requests routed to wrong department initially (delays + rerouting)
- No systematic urgency triage (emergencies mixed with routine requests)
- Limited categorization (everything goes to "general inbox")

**Pain Points**:
1. **Slow Routing**: Manual review takes 6-10 hours/day for high-volume hotels
2. **Misdirected Requests**: 20-30% sent to wrong department → double handling
3. **No Urgency Triage**: "Water leak in bathroom" treated same as "What time is breakfast?"
4. **Staff Overwhelm**: Front desk reads all requests before routing
5. **No Analytics**: Cannot track request volume by category or department

**Impact**:
- Guest request response time: 45-90 minutes average (should be <15 min)
- Staff frustration from reading 200+ requests/day
- Emergencies buried in general inbox
- No visibility into common request types

## Solution - Zero-Shot Classification System

**Technology Stack**:
- **Model**: facebook/bart-large-mnli (zero-shot classification)
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ for clear categories, 80%+ for nuanced cases
- **Speed**: <500ms per classification (local inference)
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (daily classification records as JSONB)

**Core Features**:
1. **Department Routing**: Auto-assign to correct department (90%+ accuracy)
2. **Urgency Triage**: Emergency / Urgent / Normal / Low Priority
3. **Request Type**: New booking, cancellation, complaint, inquiry, maintenance, etc.
4. **Multi-Label**: Single request can have multiple categories (e.g., "Room is dirty" = complaint + housekeeping)
5. **Custom Categories**: Add new categories instantly (no training required)

## Three-View Architecture

### 1. Classification View (Staff - Daily Operations)

**Purpose**: Real-time request classification and routing

**Morning Operations (9 AM)**:
- System displays overnight requests (pre-classified)
- Staff can verify/override classifications
- Bulk routing to departments

**Real-Time Classification**:
```typescript
interface GuestRequest {
  id: string;
  guestName?: string;
  source: 'email' | 'chat' | 'phone' | 'sms' | 'form';
  text: string;
  timestamp: string;
  classification: {
    department: {
      label: string; // e.g., "housekeeping"
      confidence: number;
    };
    requestType: {
      label: string; // e.g., "maintenance request"
      confidence: number;
    };
    urgency: {
      label: string; // "emergency" | "urgent" | "normal" | "low"
      confidence: number;
    };
  };
  status: 'pending' | 'routed' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
  routedTo?: string;
  assignedAt?: string;
}
```

**Department Categories**:
- Front Desk
- Housekeeping
- Maintenance
- Food & Beverage
- Concierge
- Management
- Billing/Accounts

**Request Type Categories**:
- New booking request
- Cancellation request
- Reservation modification
- Guest complaint
- General information question
- Housekeeping request
- Maintenance problem
- Room service order
- Concierge question
- Billing inquiry

**Urgency Levels**:
- **Emergency** (5-10%): "Water leak", "no hot water", "AC broken", "health/safety issue"
- **Urgent** (15-20%): "Check-in issue", "room not ready", "lost key", "noise complaint"
- **Normal** (60-70%): Most requests - "extra towels", "breakfast time", "WiFi password"
- **Low Priority** (10-15%): "General inquiry", "suggestion", "compliment"

**Staff Interface Features**:
- Pending requests queue (sorted by urgency + timestamp)
- One-click classification for new requests
- Bulk operations (classify 10 requests at once)
- Override classifications if incorrect
- Route to department with one click
- Search/filter by category

**Example Classification Results**:
```typescript
// Request: "The AC in room 305 is not working, it's very hot"
{
  department: { label: "maintenance", confidence: 0.95 },
  requestType: { label: "maintenance problem", confidence: 0.92 },
  urgency: { label: "urgent", confidence: 0.88 }
}

// Request: "I need extra towels in my room"
{
  department: { label: "housekeeping", confidence: 0.98 },
  requestType: { label: "housekeeping request", confidence: 0.96 },
  urgency: { label: "normal", confidence: 0.91 }
}

// Request: "URGENT: Water leak in bathroom, flooding!"
{
  department: { label: "maintenance", confidence: 0.97 },
  requestType: { label: "maintenance problem", confidence: 0.94 },
  urgency: { label: "emergency", confidence: 0.96 }
}
```

### 2. Performance View (Manager - ROI & Analytics)

**Purpose**: Track classification accuracy, routing efficiency, and staff productivity

**Key Metrics**:
```typescript
interface ClassificationMetrics {
  period: 'last_7_days' | 'last_30_days' | 'last_90_days';
  totalRequests: number;
  classificationAccuracy: number; // percentage of correct auto-classifications
  routingTime: {
    before: number; // minutes (manual routing)
    after: number; // minutes (auto-routing)
    improvement: number; // percentage
  };
  misdirectedRate: {
    before: number; // percentage (manual)
    after: number; // percentage (auto)
    reduction: number; // percentage
  };
  byDepartment: {
    [dept: string]: {
      requests: number;
      avgConfidence: number;
      avgResponseTime: number; // minutes
    };
  };
  byUrgency: {
    emergency: number;
    urgent: number;
    normal: number;
    low: number;
  };
}
```

**Before/After Comparison**:

| Metric | Before (Manual) | After (Auto-Classification) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| Avg Routing Time | 2.5 min/request | 0.2 min/request | 92% faster |
| Misdirected Requests | 25% | 8% | 68% reduction |
| Staff Time (routing) | 8-10 hrs/day | 0.5-1 hr/day | 90% reduction |
| Emergency Response Time | 45 min avg | 12 min avg | 73% faster |
| Request Volume Handled | 250/day | 500/day | 2x capacity |

**ROI Breakdown**:
1. **Faster Request Routing**: $150/month
   - Before: 8-10 hours/day × $20/hour × 22 days = $3,520-4,400/month
   - After: 0.5-1 hour/day × $20/hour × 22 days = $220-440/month
   - Savings: ~$3,000/month (using conservative $150 for routing time)

2. **Reduced Misdirected Requests**: $80/month
   - 25% → 8% misdirection rate (17% improvement)
   - Average delay from misdirection: 30 minutes
   - 250 requests/day × 17% × 0.5 hours = 21 hours/day saved
   - 21 hours/day × $20/hour × 22 days = ~$9,240/month (using conservative $80)

3. **Staff Efficiency**: $50/month
   - Reduced context switching (staff don't read all requests)
   - Faster triage (auto-prioritization)
   - Net efficiency: 2.5 hours/month × $20/hour = $50

**Total ROI**: $150 + $80 + $50 = **$280/month**

**Category Distribution** (Sample 30-day data):
- Housekeeping: 32% (80 requests/day)
- Maintenance: 22% (55 requests/day)
- Front Desk: 18% (45 requests/day)
- Food & Beverage: 12% (30 requests/day)
- Concierge: 8% (20 requests/day)
- Billing: 5% (12 requests/day)
- Management: 3% (8 requests/day)

### 3. Historical View (Last 7 Days Performance)

**Purpose**: Track daily classification patterns and accuracy trends

**Daily Metrics Schema**:
```typescript
interface DailyClassificationRecord {
  id: string;
  propertyId: string;
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD
  requests: {
    total: number;

  }>;
}
```

**Sample Historical Data** (Last 7 Days):
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-10-19",
    "requests": {
      "total": 268,

      { "type": "general information question", "count": 38, "avgConfidence": 0.87 }
    ]
  },
  // ... 6 more days
]
```

**System Insights** (Automatically Generated):
1. **Accuracy Improving**: "Classification confidence increased from 87% to 91% over 7 days. Model learning common request patterns."
2. **Housekeeping Peak**: "Housekeeping requests surge on weekends (86 → 102/day). Adjust staffing accordingly."
3. **Emergency Response**: "Average emergency response time: 12 minutes (target: <15 min). Excellent performance."
4. **Override Patterns**: "6.5% override rate. Most overrides in 'billing' category. Consider refining labels."
5. **Volume Trends**: "Total requests up 18% vs last week (228 → 268/day). System handling well."

## Data Collection & Integration

**Real-Time Operations**:
1. Request arrives (email, chat, SMS, form)
2. Extract text from request
3. Run zero-shot classification (department, type, urgency)
4. Display in staff queue (sorted by urgency + timestamp)
5. Staff review and route (or auto-route if confidence > 90%)
6. Track routing time and accuracy

**Integration Points**:
- **Email**: IMAP/Gmail API integration (fetch unread emails)
- **Chat**: Live chat widget integration (API webhook)
- **SMS**: Twilio integration (inbound SMS webhook)
- **Phone**: Transcription from speech-to-text → classification
- **Form**: Direct API integration

**Evening Operations** (Staff - 5 PM):
1. Review completed requests
2. Mark any misdirected classifications (for tracking)
3. System generates daily summary

**Weekly Operations** (Automated - Sunday 9 AM):
1. Generate weekly classification report
2. Identify accuracy trends and common request types
3. Highlight departments with low confidence (may need label refinement)
4. Email summary to management

## Implementation Details

### Zero-Shot Classification Algorithm

**Input**: Request text + candidate labels

**Model**: facebook/bart-large-mnli (400M+ parameters, trained on NLI task)

**Process**:
1. Convert classification to Natural Language Inference (NLI) task
2. For each candidate label, create hypothesis: "This text is about {label}"
3. Model predicts entailment probability (text → hypothesis)
4. Return labels sorted by probability

**Example**:
```typescript
async function classifyRequest(text: string, labels: string[]): Promise<Classification> {
  // Using Hugging Face Transformers.js (browser-based inference)
  const classifier = await pipeline('zero-shot-classification', 'facebook/bart-large-mnli');

  const result = await classifier(text, labels, {
    multi_label: true, // Allow multiple categories
    hypothesis_template: 'This message is about {}.'
  });

  return {
    labels: result.labels,
    scores: result.scores,
    topLabel: result.labels[0],
    topScore: result.scores[0]
  };
}
```

**Multi-Step Classification**:
```typescript
async function classifyGuestRequest(text: string): Promise<GuestRequestClassification> {
  // Step 1: Classify department
  const deptLabels = ['front desk', 'housekeeping', 'maintenance', 'food and beverage', 'concierge', 'billing', 'management'];
  const deptResult = await classifyRequest(text, deptLabels);

  // Step 2: Classify request type
  const typeLabels = ['new booking request', 'cancellation request', 'guest complaint', 'general inquiry', 'housekeeping request', 'maintenance problem', 'room service order'];
  const typeResult = await classifyRequest(text, typeLabels);

  // Step 3: Classify urgency
  const urgencyLabels = ['emergency', 'urgent', 'normal', 'low priority'];
  const urgencyResult = await classifyRequest(text, urgencyLabels);

  return {
    department: { label: deptResult.topLabel, confidence: deptResult.topScore },
    requestType: { label: typeResult.topLabel, confidence: typeResult.topScore },
    urgency: { label: urgencyResult.topLabel, confidence: urgencyResult.topScore }
  };
}
```

### Auto-Routing Logic

**Confidence Thresholds**:
- **High Confidence (>90%)**: Auto-route to department (no human review)
- **Medium Confidence (75-90%)**: Auto-route but flag for review
- **Low Confidence (<75%)**: Require human review before routing

**Urgency-Based Routing**:
- **Emergency**: Immediate notification to department + manager
- **Urgent**: Priority queue (SLA: respond within 15 min)
- **Normal**: Standard queue (SLA: respond within 1 hour)
- **Low Priority**: Batch processing (respond within 4 hours)

```typescript
function routeRequest(request: GuestRequest): RoutingAction {
  const { department, urgency } = request.classification;

  // Emergency bypass (always route immediately)
  if (urgency.label === 'emergency' && urgency.confidence > 0.80) {
    return {
      action: 'auto_route',
      department: department.label,
      priority: 'critical',
      notify: ['department_head', 'manager'],
      sla: 15 // minutes
    };
  }

  // High confidence auto-routing
  if (department.confidence > 0.90) {
    return {
      action: 'auto_route',
      department: department.label,
      priority: urgency.label,
      notify: ['department'],
      sla: urgency.label === 'urgent' ? 15 : 60
    };
  }

  // Medium confidence (flag for review)
  if (department.confidence > 0.75) {
    return {
      action: 'route_with_review',
      department: department.label,
      priority: urgency.label,
      reviewRequired: true
    };
  }

  // Low confidence (require human)
  return {
    action: 'human_review',
    suggestedDepartment: department.label,
    reason: 'Low confidence classification'
  };
}
```
