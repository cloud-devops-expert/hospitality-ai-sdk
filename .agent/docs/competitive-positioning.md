## Sales Conversation Scripts

### Discovery Questions:

1. **"Do you have a bar or restaurant on property?"**
   - If yes: "How many bartenders do you employ?"
   - Lead-in: "What if you could automate 50% of those shifts?"

2. **"Have you heard of self-serve beer walls like iPourIt?"**
   - If yes: "Are you frustrated they don't integrate with your PMS?"
   - If no: "Let me show you how hotels are doing 24/7 bar service without staff"

3. **"How do you currently track where guests are on property?"**
   - Most: "We don't, just their room number"
   - Lead-in: "What if you could offer different services based on their location?"

4. **"What's your current PMS costing you per month?"**
   - Oracle: $670-1,670/month (40 rooms)
   - Mews: $240-490/month
   - Us: $50-150/month
   - Lead-in: "What if you could add bar automation for LESS than you're paying now?"

### Objection Handling:

**"We already have a PMS (Oracle/Mews/Cloudbeds)"**
- "That's fine! We integrate with your PMS via API. We're not replacing it, we're adding the bar automation layer they don't offer."
- "Think of us as the 'IoT module' for your existing PMS."

**"We don't need bar automation"**
- "Fair enough. Are you paying night bartenders $15-25/hour?"
- "With self-serve, your rooftop bar can operate 24/7 with zero labor."
- "Hotels with self-serve see 25% increase in beverage sales (impulse purchases)."

**"This sounds expensive"**
- "$50-150/month total, not per room. For a 40-room hotel, Oracle costs $8,000-20,000/year. We're $600-1,800/year."
- "One less bartender shift per night saves you $40,000/year. We cost $1,800."

**"We need to see a demo first"**
- "Absolutely! I can show you live right now - I'll track my phone as I walk around. Watch the drink menu change."
- "Or I can fly out with a Bibo cocktail kiosk and Berg demo unit. You'll see it working in your lobby."
