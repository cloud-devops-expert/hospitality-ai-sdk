## Market Positioning

### We're NOT competing with Oracle/Mews on PMS features.

### We're an ISV/SI (HARD RULE):
**"Middleware for Hospitality - Connect Your Existing Systems"**

**Category Characteristics**:
1. Real-time guest location tracking (WiFi-based) - using client's existing WiFi
2. Hardware integration (IF client already has dispensers, sensors, IoT devices)
3. Zone-based contextual services
4. Local-first architecture with offline capability
5. Cost-effective ($50-150/month, not per-room)

**Category Tagline**: **"Middleware for Hospitality - Connect Your Existing Systems"**

**IMPORTANT**: We integrate what clients ALREADY HAVE, we don't sell or promote hardware.

## Sales Conversation Scripts (ISV/SI Model)

### Discovery Questions:

1. **"What systems do you currently have on property?"**
   - Listen for: PMS (Oracle, Mews, etc.), POS (Toast, Square), WiFi (UniFi, Aruba), bar equipment
   - Lead-in: "Do these systems talk to each other, or do you manually enter data between them?"

2. **"Do you have any bar equipment with APIs?"**
   - If yes: "Is it integrated with your PMS for automatic room billing?"
   - If no: "That's okay. We focus on integrating your PMS, POS, and WiFi first."

3. **"How much time do your staff spend double-entering data?"**
   - Most: "A lot - between PMS, POS, and other systems"
   - Lead-in: "What if we could eliminate 80% of that double-entry with middleware?"

4. **"What's the biggest pain point with your current tech stack?"**
   - Listen for: Manual data entry, systems don't talk, errors from re-typing
   - Lead-in: "That's exactly what middleware solves - we connect your existing systems."

### Objection Handling:

**"We already have a PMS (Oracle/Mews/Cloudbeds)"**
- "Perfect! We integrate WITH your PMS via API. We're not replacing it, we're connecting it to your other systems."
- "Think of us as middleware - like Zapier, but built specifically for hospitality."

**"We don't have any fancy equipment to integrate"**
- "That's actually ideal. We focus on connecting your basic systems first - PMS, POS, WiFi."
- "Reducing double-entry between those three systems alone saves 10+ hours per week."

**"This sounds expensive"**
- "$50-150/month total, not per room. We save you 10+ staff hours per week on data entry."
- "At $15/hour, that's $600-800/month saved. We cost $50-150."

**"We need to see a demo first"**
- "Absolutely! I can show you live right now - our WiFi integration with location tracking."
- "If you have specific equipment you want integrated, let me know and I'll show you how we'd connect it via API."

---

## Integration Strategy (ISV/SI Model - HARD RULE)

### Public Integration Support (Low Risk):

**We publicly advertise integration with these systems (they won't compete with us):**

1. **PMS Systems** (Oracle OPERA, Mews, Cloudbeds, Stayntouch, Apaleo)
   - Public value: "We integrate with your existing PMS via API"
   - Risk: LOW (they don't care about middleware)

2. **POS Systems** (Toast, Square, Lightspeed, MICROS)
   - Public value: "We sync your POS with your PMS automatically"
   - Risk: LOW (different market)

3. **WiFi Systems** (UniFi, Aruba, Cisco Meraki)
   - Public value: "We use your WiFi for location tracking"
   - Risk: LOW (UniFi doesn't care about hospitality)

4. **Payment Gateways** (Stripe, Square, Adyen)
   - Public value: "We integrate with your payment processor"
   - Risk: LOW (they're agnostic)

5. **Voice Assistants** (Alexa, Google Assistant)
   - Public value: "We integrate with your voice assistant"
   - Risk: LOW (Amazon/Google don't care about hotels)

### Private/Client-Driven Integration (High Risk):

**We integrate ONLY if client requests, and we DON'T publicize these integrations:**

1. **Bar Dispensers** (Berg, Barpay, iPourIt, WineEmotion)
   - Private: Only integrate if client already has equipment
   - Public: "We integrate with bar equipment if you have it"
   - Risk: HIGH (they might copy our integration patterns)
   - **NEVER tell vendors what features they're missing**

2. **Self-Serve Beer** (Arryved, PourMyBeer)
   - Private: Client-driven integration only
   - Public: "We support self-serve systems with APIs"
   - Risk: HIGH (might partner with PMS vendors directly)

3. **Coffee Systems** (Franke, WMF)
   - Private: Client-driven only
   - Public: "We integrate commercial equipment with APIs"
   - Risk: MEDIUM (might build hospitality integration)

### Avoid (Too Risky):

- **NEVER approach hardware vendors** to "partner" or "co-market"
- **NEVER share our integration patterns** with hardware vendors
- **NEVER tell vendors** "you should add this feature"
- **WHY**: They can build it in-house and cut us out of business

## Recommended Tagline (ISV/SI Model)

**Primary**: "Middleware for Hospitality - Connect Your Existing Systems"

**Alternates**:
- "Stop Double-Entering Data - We Connect Your Systems"
- "Integrate Your PMS, POS, WiFi, and More"
- "Hospitality Middleware - Like Zapier, But Better"
- "Connect What You Already Have"

**Why Primary Wins**:
- Clear (explains we're middleware, not hardware)
- Client-focused (emphasizes their existing systems)
- Defensible (we're ISV/SI, not competing with hardware vendors)
- Non-threatening (we complement, we don't replace)
- Memorable (hospitality middleware is new category)

**What We DON'T Say**:
- ❌ "The First Location-Aware IoT Platform" (sounds like VAR)
- ❌ "Smart Bar Automation" (sounds like we sell bar equipment)
- ❌ "Official Integration Partner" (risky partnerships)
- ❌ Anything that implies we sell or promote hardware
