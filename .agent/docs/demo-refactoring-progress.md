## 🎯 Three-View Architecture Pattern

Every completed demo follows a consistent structure:

### View 1: Staff Operations
- **Purpose**: Actionable daily work
- **Features**: Queues, alerts, interactive tools, real-time status
- **Example**: Pending reviews to analyze, housekeeping rooms to assign

### View 2: Manager Performance
- **Purpose**: ROI metrics and business value
- **Features**: Before/after comparison, accuracy stats, cost breakdown
- **Example**: $1,500/month savings, 88% forecast accuracy

### View 3: Historical
- **Purpose**: 7-day trends and system learning
- **Features**: Daily performance table, insights, continuous improvement
- **Example**: "Accuracy improved from 85% to 90% this week"

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

### Technology Philosophy

1. **Operations Research > ML** where possible ($0 cost)
   - Housekeeping: Constraint satisfaction
   - Laundry: Bin packing + greedy
   - Maintenance: Shortest path
   - Inventory: Exponential moving average

2. **Traditional ML > Generative AI** for classification
   - Sentiment: Keyword-based + BERT
   - Classification: Zero-shot NLI (BART)
   - Translation: NLLB-200 (foundation model, not generative)

3. **LLMs only where justified** (creative text generation)
   - Review Response: GPT-4o-mini / Claude Haiku
   - Rationale: Creative text, tone matching, personalization
   - Still NET positive ROI ($380/month after LLM costs)

4. **Gradient Boosting > Transformers** for forecasting
   - LightGBM: 87-90% accuracy, <100ms, CPU-only
   - TimesFM: 90-95% accuracy (only 3-5% better), 10-15x slower, needs GPU
   - Use both: LightGBM for daily ops, TimesFM for strategic planning

### Infrastructure Decisions

1. **CPU-first for most workloads**
   - LightGBM, BERT, keyword-based, operations research
   - Saves $200-400/month vs GPU

2. **GPU only for strategic forecasting**
   - TimesFM (long-range occupancy/revenue)
   - Justified by $2,000/month ROI

3. **Document-based daily tracking**
   - Not real-time streaming systems
   - PostgreSQL JSONB for daily records
   - Simple, reliable, cost-effective
