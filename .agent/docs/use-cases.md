## 4. Demand Forecasting

### Business Value

- Plan staffing levels
- Optimize inventory
- Inform pricing strategies
- Prepare for high/low demand periods

### Implementation Approaches

#### Statistical Methods (Cost: $0)

- **Moving Average**: Simple 7-day average
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Weight recent data (α=0.3)
- **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression for trend detection

### Methods Explained

**Moving Average**

```
Forecast = Average(last 7 days)
Use: Stable baseline prediction
```

**Exponential Smoothing**

```
S(t) = α × Y(t) + (1-α) × S(t-1)
Use: Responsive to recent changes
```

**Trend Analysis**

```
y = mx + b (linear regression)
Use: Detect increasing/decreasing patterns
```

**Ensemble Method** (Recommended)

```
Forecast = 0.4×MA + 0.4×ES + 0.2×Trend
Use: Balanced, robust prediction
```

### Seasonality Detection

Analyzes weekly patterns:

- Groups historical data by day of week
- Calculates variance from mean
- Detects if variation > 10% threshold

### Sample Forecast

```
Historical: 60 days of occupancy data
Forecast: Next 14 days

Results:
Day 1 (Sat): 78% (85% confidence) ↗ increasing
Day 2 (Sun): 72% (83% confidence) ↗ increasing
Day 7 (Fri): 81% (80% confidence) ↗ increasing
Day 14 (Fri): 79% (75% confidence) → stable

Insights:
✓ Demand trending upward
✓ Weekly pattern detected (Fri-Sat peaks)
✓ Recommend: Adjust prices higher
