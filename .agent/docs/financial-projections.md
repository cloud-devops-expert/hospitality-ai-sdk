| **Enterprise** | 200+ rooms | Custom | Custom | Unlimited + white-label + SLA |

**Conversion Funnel**:
```
Free users: 10,000 (Month 12)
  â†“ 15% conversion to Starter
Starter: 1,500 @ $29/mo = $43,500/mo
  â†“ 30% upgrade to Growth
Growth: 450 @ $99/mo = $44,550/mo
  â†“ 20% upgrade to Pro
Pro: 90 @ $299/mo = $26,910/mo
  â†“ 10% to Enterprise
Enterprise: 9 @ $1,500/mo avg = $13,500/mo

Total MRR (Month 12): $128,460
Annual recurring: $1,541,520
```

#### B. API Usage Fees (15% of revenue)

**Pricing**: $0.10 per 1,000 API calls above tier limits

**Usage Pattern** (average customer):
- Starter: 8K ops/month (below 10K limit) â†’ $0 extra

- Pro: 1.5M ops/month (500K above 1M limit) â†’ $50/month extra

**Projected API Revenue**:
```
Month 12:
- Growth tier: 450 customers Ã— $2 avg = $900/mo

**Model**: $0.50-1.00 per property per month via partner PMS

**Partner Targets**:
- Year 1: 2 partnerships (Cloudbeds, Guesty)
- Year 2: 5 partnerships
- Year 3: 10 partnerships

**Revenue Share**: 70/30 (partner/us)

**Projections**:
```
Year 1 (assuming 2 partners, 500 properties each):
1,000 properties Ã— $0.50/mo Ã— 12 months = $6,000/year

Year 2 (5 partners, 2,000 properties each):
10,000 properties Ã— $0.75/mo Ã— 12 months = $90,000/year

Year 3 (10 partners, 5,000 properties each):
50,000 properties Ã— $1.00/mo Ã— 12 months = $600,000/year
```

#### D. Professional Services (5% of revenue)

**Offerings**:
- Custom integrations: $5,000-15,000 per project
- Consulting: $200/hour
- Training: $1,000/day
- Custom development: $150-250/hour

**Year 1 Target**: 10 projects @ $8,000 avg = $80,000

## Profitability Analysis

### Monthly P&L (Base Case)

**Month 6** (Break-even target):
```
Revenue:
- Subscriptions: $64,896/mo
- API usage: $3,888/mo
- Services (pro-rated): $10,000/mo
Total: $78,784/mo

Costs:
- Team: $31,667/mo
- Infrastructure: $600/mo
- Marketing: $4,500/mo
- Operations: $5,333/mo
Total: $42,100/mo

Net Profit: $36,684/mo âœ…
Margin: 46.5%
```

### Annual P&L

**Year 1**:
```
Revenue:      $3,429,000
Costs:        $587,700
EBITDA:       $2,841,300
Margin:       82.9% ðŸš€

Note: Assumes lean operation, founders take minimal salary
```

**Year 2**:
```
Revenue:      $18,855,000
Costs:        $1,549,000
EBITDA:       $17,306,000
Margin:       91.8% ðŸš€
```

**Year 3**:
```
Revenue:      $65,616,000
Costs:        $3,139,000
EBITDA:       $62,477,000
Margin:       95.2% ðŸš€
```

**Why Such High Margins?**
- SaaS model (low marginal cost per customer)
- Product-led growth (low sales overhead)
- Automated operations (minimal support needed)
- Hybrid AI (infrastructure costs are ~1% of revenue)

---

## Unit Economics

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Calculation**:
```
LTV = (ARPU Ã— Gross Margin) / Churn Rate

ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):
- Starter: $29/mo
- Growth: $99/mo
- Pro: $299/mo
- Blended: $74/mo (Year 1)

Gross Margin: 95% (SaaS typical)
Churn Rate: 4% monthly (48% annual)

LTV = ($74 Ã— 0.95) / 0.04 = $1,755
```

### LTV:CAC Ratio

```
Year 1: $1,755 / $15.43 = 113.8x ðŸŽ¯
Year 2: $2,166 / $24.00 = 90.3x ðŸŽ¯
Year 3: $2,491 / $25.00 = 99.6x ðŸŽ¯

Target: >3x (we're at 90-114x!)
```

**Why so high?**
- Product-led growth (users discover organically)
- Freemium model (try before buy)
- Low CAC due to word-of-mouth
- High retention due to value delivered

### Churn Analysis

**Assumptions by Tier**:
| Tier | Monthly Churn | Annual Churn | Reasoning |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Starter | 6% | 72% | High experimentation |
| Growth | 4% | 48% | Sticky value prop |
| Pro | 2% | 24% | Mission-critical |
| Enterprise | 0.5% | 6% | Long contracts |

**Blended**: 4% monthly, 48% annual

**Churn Reduction Strategies**:
- Onboarding: Ensure value in first 7 days
- Education: Weekly tips, best practices
- Support: Fast response (<2 hours)
- Product: Continuously add value
- Pricing: Fair, transparent

**Target Churn**:
- Year 1: 4% monthly
- Year 2: 3% monthly
- Year 3: 2.5% monthly

## Cash Flow Analysis

### Year 1 Cash Flow (Monthly)

| Month | Revenue | Costs | Net Cash | Cumulative |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | $3,200 | $35,400 | -$32,200 | -$32,200 |
| 2 | $7,808 | $38,267 | -$30,459 | -$62,659 |
| 3 | $13,888 | $41,533 | -$27,645 | -$90,304 |

| 9 | $139,328 | $63,833 | $75,495 | -$75,230 |
| 12 | $224,000 | $82,000 | $142,000 | **+$350,000** âœ… |

**Cash Flow Positive**: Month 6
**Cumulative Positive**: Month 10

### Funding Requirements

**Bootstrap Scenario** (no external funding):
- Founders: $0 salary for 6 months
- Minimal team (1 engineer Month 4)
- Slower growth
- **Funding needed**: $0 (live off initial revenue)
- **Time to profitability**: Month 6

**Seed Funding Scenario** ($500K):
- Founders: Modest salary from Month 7
- Faster hiring (3 engineers Year 1)
- Aggressive marketing
- **Runway**: 18 months
- **Use of funds**:
  - Team: $300K
  - Marketing: $100K
  - Infrastructure: $20K
  - Operations: $80K
- **Outcome**: $3.4M ARR by Month 12

**Series A Scenario** ($3M at end of Year 1):
- Scale team to 15 people
- Aggressive marketing ($1M/year)
- Enterprise sales team
- International expansion
- **Runway**: 24 months
- **Target**: $20M ARR by end of Year 2

---

## Scenario Comparison

### Bootstrap vs. Funded

| Metric | Bootstrap | Seed ($500K) | Series A ($3M) |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Year 1 ARR** | $1.6M | $3.4M | $5.4M |
| **Year 2 ARR** | $8.5M | $18.9M | $28.7M |
| **Year 3 ARR** | $27M | $65M | $99M |
| **Team Size (Year 1)** | 3 | 7 | 12 |
| **Marketing Spend (Year 1)** | $30K | $54K | $150K |
| **Dilution** | 0% | 20-25% | 35-40% |
| **Time to Profitability** | Month 6 | Month 8 | Month 14 |

### Recommendation

**Best Path**: **Seed funding ($500K)**

**Rationale**:
- Market moving fast (competitors emerging)
- Need to capture market share quickly
- Can still achieve profitability within 18 months
- Moderate dilution (20-25%)
- Attracts top talent with cash compensation
- Allows for product polish and marketing

**Alternative**: **Bootstrap to $1M ARR, then raise**
- Proves product-market fit
- Better valuation
- Less dilution
- But: Slower growth, risk of being overtaken

### Investment Thesis

**For $500K seed investment**:
- **Valuation**: $2-3M pre-money (15-20% dilution)
- **Use of funds**: Team, marketing, product
- **Milestones**:
  - Month 12: $3.4M ARR, 3,500 customers
  - Month 18: Cash flow positive
  - Month 24: $18.9M ARR, ready for Series A
- **Exit potential**:
  - Strategic acquisition: 5-8x ARR = $95-150M (Year 3)
  - IPO path: 10-15x ARR = $650M-1B (Year 5)

**Best-in-class SaaS metrics** with proven demand in underserved market.

**Next Steps**:
1. Validate financial model with first 100 customers
2. Refine CAC based on actual acquisition data
3. Adjust churn assumptions after 6 months
4. Re-forecast quarterly based on actuals
