# ML Approaches & Cost Analysis

Comprehensive comparison of Machine Learning approaches vs Traditional algorithms across all modules of the Hospitality AI SDK.

## Philosophy

> **The right tool for the right job, at the right cost.**

This SDK provides multiple implementation approaches for each feature:

- **Traditional**: Rule-based, algorithmic, statistical methods (Free, Fast)
- **Browser ML**: Local models running in browser (Free, Medium speed)
- **Cloud ML**: API-based models (Paid, Variable speed)
- **Hybrid**: Smart escalation between methods (Optimal cost/accuracy)

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Caching

```typescript
// Cache sentiment results for 24 hours
// Reduces API calls by 60-80%
const cache = new Map();
if (cache.has(text)) return cache.get(text);
```

### 2. Batch Processing

```typescript
// Process 100 reviews at once
// Reduces overhead by 30-40%
const results = await batchAnalyze(reviews);
```

### 3. Smart Thresholds

```typescript
// Only use AI when confidence is low
if (traditionalResult.confidence < 0.6) {
  return await analyzeWithAI(text);
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting

```typescript
// Cap API calls per day
// Prevents cost spikes
if (dailyApiCalls > 1000) return traditionalFallback();
```

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Cost Monitoring

```typescript
// Track spending in real-time
const costTracker = {
  sentiment: 0,
  allocation: 0,
  pricing: 0,
  forecast: 0,
};

// Alert when approaching budget
if (costTracker.sentiment > 100) {
  alert('Sentiment API cost exceeds $100/month');
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
// Track latency percentiles
const latencyStats = {
  p50: 45, // median
  p95: 120, // 95th percentile
  p99: 250, // 99th percentile
};
```
