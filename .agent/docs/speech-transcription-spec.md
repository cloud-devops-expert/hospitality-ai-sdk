# Speech Transcription - Technical Specification

## Overview

**Purpose**: Automated transcription of audio to text using OpenAI Whisper for call center QA, voice notes, meetings.

**Technology**: OpenAI Whisper (open-source speech recognition, 99 languages).

**Cost**: $0/month (on-premise deployment) + $22/month AWS IoT Greengrass (if cloud backup needed).

**Business Value**: $550/month savings ($6,600/year) from call center QA automation and voice note transcription.

## Business Problem

### Current Situation
Hotels generate hours of audio daily but lack systematic transcription:
- **Call center recordings**: 200-300 calls/day (guest inquiries, complaints, reservations)
- **Voice notes**: 50-100/day (housekeeping reports, maintenance updates, manager notes)
- **Meeting recordings**: 10-15 hours/month (staff meetings, training sessions)
- **Current process**: Manual review (1-2% of calls), no searchable archive, quality issues undetected

### Manual Process
- Quality assurance manager manually listens to 5-10 random calls/day (1-2% of total)
- Takes notes manually during review (1 hour audio = 2 hours review time)
- No systematic tracking of common issues, complaint themes, or staff performance
- Voice notes not transcribed (stored as audio files, not searchable)
- Meeting notes typed manually during meetings (incomplete, requires full attention)

### Pain Points
1. **Labor intensive**: QA manager spends 10-15 hours/week on call review ($400/week × 52 weeks = $20,800/year)
2. **Limited coverage**: Only 1-2% of calls reviewed (98% of issues go undetected)
3. **Not searchable**: Can't search audio for "guest mentioned slow check-in" or "price complaint"
4. **Delayed insights**: Manual review takes days, issues not caught in real-time
5. **Missed training opportunities**: Great service examples not identified for training

## Solution

### Automated Speech Transcription Pipeline
Whisper AI for real-time audio-to-text conversion:
- **100% coverage**: Every call transcribed automatically
- **Searchable database**: Find any keyword across all calls in seconds
- **Real-time alerts**: Flag complaints, issues, specific keywords immediately
- **Quality insights**: Automated sentiment analysis, theme extraction
- **Training library**: Auto-identify best/worst calls for staff training

### ROI Breakdown

**Labor Savings**: $400/month ($4,800/year)
- Before: 15 hours/week QA review × $26/hr = $390/week = $20,280/year
- After: 3 hours/week review flagged calls × $26/hr = $78/week = $4,056/year
- Savings: $16,224/year labor (we conservatively count $4,800)

**Voice Note Efficiency**: $150/month ($1,800/year)
- Housekeeping/maintenance voice notes become immediately searchable
- "What room needs extra pillows?" → instant text search vs. listening to 10 audio files
- Estimated 5 hours/week saved across staff

**Total ROI**: $550/month ($6,600/year)

**Infrastructure Costs**:
- Whisper model: Free (MIT license)
- Intel NUC server: $400 one-time (if not already deployed)
- AWS IoT Greengrass: $22/month (optional, for cloud backup)

**Net Savings**: $528/month after infrastructure costs ($6,336/year)

### Implementation Approach

**Deployment Model**: On-premise (Intel NUC) or edge (AWS Greengrass)
- **On-premise**: For HIPAA compliance (medical notes), data privacy
- **Real-time**: Transcribe during call (streaming) or post-call (batch)

**Technology Stack**:
```
Phone System → Audio Recording → Whisper Transcription
                                        ↓
                                PostgreSQL (full-text search)
                                        ↓
                                Dashboard + Alerts
```
