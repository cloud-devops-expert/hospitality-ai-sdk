## Demo Scenarios for Sales

### Scenario 1: Boutique Hotel with Bar Equipment

**Client Profile**:
- 40 rooms, 75% occupancy
- 15 staff, $18/hour average
- Has: Cloudbeds PMS, Toast POS, UniFi WiFi, **iPourIt beer wall**

**Demo Flow**:
1. Show ROI calculator with their profile
   - Result: $4,201/month savings, 0.6 month payback
2. Show location tracking demo
   - Walk around with phone, show zone detection
3. Show bar integration demo
   - Beer wall automatically charges to rooms
   - No manual entry needed

**Sales Pitch**:
> "You have iPourIt? Perfect! We'll connect it to your PMS. Beer pours automatically charge to rooms. You'll save $4,201/month, break even in less than a month, and free up 1.3 FTEs worth of productivity."

**Closing**: "We integrate what you already have. No hardware to buy, just middleware."

---

### Scenario 2: Business Hotel (No Bar Equipment)

**Client Profile**:
- 120 rooms, 80% occupancy

1. Show ROI calculator with their profile
   - Result: $7,035/month savings, 0.2 month payback
2. Show location tracking demo
   - Conference center, meeting rooms, restaurants
3. Explain bar integration is OPTIONAL
   - "If you add bar equipment later, we can integrate it"

**Sales Pitch**:
> "Without bar equipment, you still save $7,035/month by eliminating double-entry between PMS, POS, and WiFi. Break even in 0.2 months. If you add bar equipment later, we'll integrate it."

**Closing**: "We're not here to sell you hardware. We connect what you already have."

---

### Scenario 3: Independent Hotel (Budget Conscious)

**Client Profile**:
- 25 rooms, 65% occupancy

**Demo Flow**:
1. Show ROI calculator with their profile
   - Result: $1,896/month savings, 0.8 month payback
2. Explain UniFi WiFi integration is OPTIONAL
   - "PMS + POS sync alone saves you 1,608 hours/year"
3. Show pricing: $50/month (not per-room)
   - "Competitors charge $2-8 PER ROOM per night"

**Sales Pitch**:
> "You'll save $1,896/month just by connecting your PMS and POS. No UniFi? No problem. We focus on what you already have. You'll still break even in 0.8 months."

**Closing**: "We're 10x cheaper than Oracle or Mews, and we reduce double-entry by 70%."

## Key Sales Messages (ISV/SI Model)

### ‚úÖ DO SAY:

1. **"What systems do you currently have?"**
   - Client-driven discovery
   - Focus on existing hardware

2. **"We integrate what you already have"**
   - Middleware value proposition
   - No hardware sales

3. **"You'll save $X/month, break even in Y months"**
   - Quantifiable ROI
   - Hard numbers from calculator

4. **"We're not replacing your PMS, we're connecting it"**
   - Complement, not compete
   - Add-on value

5. **"If you add equipment later, we can integrate it"**
   - Future-proof

2. ‚ùå "We're the official integration partner of Berg"
   - Risky vendor partnership
   - They might cut us out

3. ‚ùå "Your pool system needs an API"
   - Arrogant tone
   - Vendor will build it themselves

4. ‚ùå "We're the first location-aware IoT platform"
   - Sounds like VAR positioning
   - Focus on middleware instead

5. ‚ùå "Let me show you our Berg demo unit"
   - Implies hardware sales

   - Bar inventory: 85% reduction (IF client has bar equipment with API)
   - Error corrections: 75% reduction (fewer errors with automation)

2. **Cost Savings**:
   - Labor savings = Hours saved √ó Hourly rate
   - Error savings = Current errors √ó 75% √ó Error cost
   - Total savings = Labor + Error reduction

3. **Platform Cost**:
   - Small hotels (<30 rooms): $50/month
   - Medium hotels (30-100 rooms): $100/month

## Competitive Positioning (ISV/SI Model)

### Our Advantage: Measurable ROI

**Competitors**:
- Oracle OPERA: $200-500/room/year = $8,000-20,000/year (40 rooms)
- Mews: $4-8/room/night = $2,920-5,840/year (40 rooms)
- Cloudbeds: $1,825-3,285/year (40 rooms)

**Us**:
- $50-150/month = $600-1,800/year (TOTAL, not per-room)
- 10x cheaper than Oracle
- 2-5x cheaper than Mews/Cloudbeds

**Value Add**:
- ZERO competitors have WiFi-based location tracking + PMS/POS middleware
- ZERO competitors integrate bar dispensers with PMS
- ALL competitors charge per-room (we charge flat rate)

### Our Differentiation: Client-Driven Integration

**Competitors Say**: "We integrate with X, Y, Z systems"

**We Say**:
- "What systems do you already have?"
- "If you have X, we'll integrate it"
- "If you don't have X, we focus on what you DO have"

**Why This Wins**:
- Client-focused (not hardware-focused)
- Lower risk (no hardware sales pressure)
- More credible (we're not selling anything)
