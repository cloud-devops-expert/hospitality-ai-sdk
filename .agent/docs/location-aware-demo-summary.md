- ✅ Context-aware service menus
- ✅ Zone-specific greetings
- ✅ Automatic location change detection
- ✅ Signal quality monitoring

**Supported Zones:**
- 🛏️ **Room**: Room service, climate control, housekeeping, entertainment
- 💼 **Office**: Business services, meeting rooms, printing
- 🏨 **Lobby**: Check-in/out, transportation, local guide
- 🍽️ **Restaurant**: Food ordering, menu, bill requests
- 💆 **Spa**: Treatments, pool/sauna, poolside service

### 3. UniFi Cloud API Setup Guide
Created comprehensive guide for setting up remote access:
- ✅ Step-by-step Cloud API key generation
- ✅ Security best practices

**Demo Flow:**
```bash
npm run demo:location
```

1. Connects to UniFi controller
2. Finds connected devices
3. Tracks selected device location
4. Shows context-aware guest portal
5. Monitors for location changes in real-time

- "Office" → office
- "Lobby", "Reception" → lobby
- "Restaurant", "Dining" → restaurant
- "Spa", "Pool", "Gym" → spa

## 🎯 Use Cases Demonstrated

### 1. Room Service Ordering
Guest in bedroom → sees room service menu
```
🛏️ Room Service
   Order breakfast, snacks, or beverages to your room
   ✅ [Order Now]
```

### 2. Business Center Access
Guest in office → sees business services
```
💼 Business Services
   Printing, scanning, and document services
   ✅ [Access Services]
```

### 3. Automatic Menu Updates
Guest walks from bedroom → office:
```
🚶 Location changed: room → office
   Moving to: AC LR - Office

[Portal updates to show office services]
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Authentication Methods Supported
1. ✅ UniFi Cloud API (recommended)
2. ✅ Local API token (for MFA accounts)
3. ✅ Session token (quick testing)
4. ✅ Username/password (legacy)

### API Endpoints Used
- `/proxy/network/api/self` - User verification
- `/proxy/network/api/s/default/stat/device` - Access points
- `/proxy/network/api/s/default/stat/sta` - Connected clients

### Location Accuracy
- **Zone-level**: ±10-30m (WiFi AP coverage area)
- **Update frequency**: 5 seconds
- **Method**: WiFi association tracking

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Testing
1. **Test location changes:**
   ```bash
   npm run demo:location
   ```
   Walk with your phone between rooms and watch the portal update!

2. **Try with your devices:**
   - Connect your phone to WiFi
   - Watch it detect which room you're in
   - Move to different areas

### For Production

1. **Set up Cloud API** (recommended):
   - Follow `.agent/docs/unifi-cloud-api-setup.md`
   - Get API key from https://account.ui.com/api
   - Add to `.env.local`: `UNIFI_CLOUD_KEY=your_key`

2. **Improve zone mapping:**
   - Rename APs in UniFi controller for better detection
   - Update zone patterns in `mapAPToZone()` function

3. **Integrate with services:**
   - Connect to POS system for real ordering
   - Link to HVAC for climate control
   - Integrate housekeeping management system

4. **Add BLE beacons** (optional):
   - Upgrade to UniFi 6 series APs
   - Enable BLE beacons for table-level accuracy
   - Implement BLE scanning in guest app

## 📈 Business Value

### Cost Savings
- ✅ **No hardware investment**: Uses existing WiFi
- ✅ **No beacon installation**: WiFi-based location works today
- ✅ **Free API**: UniFi Cloud API has no usage charges

### Guest Experience
- ✅ **Contextual services**: Right service at right time
- ✅ **Reduced friction**: No manual zone selection
- ✅ **Faster service**: Staff knows guest location

### Operations
- ✅ **Real-time tracking**: Know where guests are
- ✅ **Service optimization**: Route staff efficiently
- ✅ **Analytics**: Understand guest movement patterns

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **WiFi location works well**: Zone-level accuracy sufficient for most use cases
2. **MFA requires tokens**: Can't use username/password with MFA enabled
3. **UniFi OS vs Legacy**: Different API paths, auto-detection works
4. **Cloud API is best**: Remote access, no MFA issues, easier setup

## 💡 Tips

### Improving Location Accuracy
1. Name APs descriptively: "Bedroom 201", "Lobby Main", "Restaurant Patio"
2. Optimize AP placement for zone coverage
3. Consider BLE beacons for table-level accuracy

### Testing Location Changes
1. Walk between rooms with phone
2. Watch demo update every 5 seconds
3. Note signal strength changes

### Production Considerations
1. Use Cloud API for remote access
2. Cache location data to reduce API calls
3. Implement offline mode for network issues
