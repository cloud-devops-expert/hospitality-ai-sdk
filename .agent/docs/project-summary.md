## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Principles

1. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Traditional methods first (free, fast)
   - AI escalation when needed (costly, accurate)
   - Smart decision logic based on confidence

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - 70% cost savings vs AI-only
   - Zero-cost alternatives for all features
   - Local-first processing

3. **TypeScript Throughout**
   - Full type safety
   - Clear interfaces and types
   - IntelliSense support

4. **Modern Stack**
   - Next.js 15 (App Router)
   - React Server Components
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Serverless-ready

### Code Quality

- **Modularity**: Each feature is self-contained
- **Reusability**: Shared types and utilities
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments throughout
- **Examples**: Demo pages for each feature
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks
