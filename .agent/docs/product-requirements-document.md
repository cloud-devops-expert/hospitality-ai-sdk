## Product Vision

### The Problem

**Current State:**
- Hotel managers juggle 5-10 different systems (PMS, RMS, CRM, housekeeping, etc.)
- ML insights buried in dashboards that require interpretation
- Expensive enterprise solutions ($5k-50k/year) out of reach for independent hotels
- No contextual intelligence - systems don't "understand" your hotel

**Pain Points:**
- "I need to check 3 different screens to understand occupancy trends"
- "Our revenue management system recommended $299, but I don't know why"
- "I found out about a VIP guest no-show after they didn't arrive"
- "I spend 2 hours daily reviewing reports instead of helping guests"

### The Solution

**HotelMind AI** is your hotel's intelligent assistant that:
- **Understands context** - Knows your property, guests, patterns, and goals
- **Speaks naturally** - Ask "Will we be fully booked this weekend?" instead of running reports
- **Acts proactively** - Surfaces insights before you need to ask
- **Simplifies decisions** - Explains recommendations in plain language
- **Takes action** - One-click to adjust prices, send messages, reassign rooms

### Product Principles

1. **Intelligence, not complexity** - More AI, fewer buttons
2. **Proactive, not reactive** - Anticipate needs before questions are asked
3. **Actionable, not informational** - Every insight has a clear next step
4. **Conversational, not dashboard-driven** - Natural language over SQL queries
5. **Unified, not fragmented** - One timeline for all hotel events

## User Personas

### 1. Sarah - Independent Hotel Owner (Primary)

**Background:**
- Owns a 25-room boutique hotel
- Wears many hats: owner, GM, revenue manager
- Tech-savvy but time-poor
- Can't afford enterprise RMS ($15k/year)

**Goals:**
- Maximize revenue without hiring a revenue manager
- Reduce no-shows and last-minute cancellations
- Provide personalized guest experiences
- Spend more time with guests, less time on admin

**Pain Points:**
- Too many systems to check daily
- Pricing decisions feel like guesswork
- Misses revenue opportunities (upsells, optimal pricing)
- Can't predict busy periods accurately

**How HotelMind Helps:**
- Morning briefing: "3 high-risk no-shows today, 2 VIP arrivals, suggested price increase for weekend"
- Natural pricing: "Should I increase rates for next weekend?" → "Yes, demand is 40% above average. Increase to $189 (+$30)"
- Guest insights: Automatic segmentation shows 60% are "value seekers" → Targeted package promotions

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Intelligence Over Complexity

**Bad Example:**
```
Dashboard with 20 metrics, 5 charts, 10 filters
User needs to interpret data themselves
```

**Good Example:**
```
"💡 Increase Saturday rate to $219 (+$30)"
"Why? Concert in town, demand up 40%, competitors at $230"
[Apply Price] button
```

### 2. Proactive Over Reactive

**Bad Example:**
```
User checks dashboard daily to find issues
Discovers no-show after guest doesn't arrive
```

**Good Example:**
```
Morning briefing: "🔴 High-risk no-show: Room 305 (78%)"
Suggested action: "Send reminder now"
[Send Reminder] button
```

### 3. Conversational Over Dashboard-Driven

**Bad Example:**
```
Navigate: Reports → Occupancy → Select Date Range → Run Report
Interpret chart and table manually
```

**Good Example:**
```
Ask: "What's occupancy next weekend?"
Response: "87% (±3%), 15% above last year"
```

### 4. Mobile-First

**Requirements:**
- All features accessible on mobile
- Touch-optimized (min 44px tap targets)
- Offline mode for critical features
- Progressive Web App (add to home screen)

### 5. Accessibility

**Requirements:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast mode
- Internationalization ready (i18n)

| Pricing expectations (free) | Medium | Medium | Freemium model, value demonstration |
| Data privacy concerns | Low | Low | Local-first architecture, transparency |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Support burden | Medium | High | Good docs, community forum, automation |
| Feature creep | Medium | High | Strict PRD adherence, user feedback |
| Technical debt | Medium | Medium | Code quality standards, regular refactoring |

## Open Questions

### Product

1. Should we support multi-language from day 1?
2. Voice input priority (Phase 2 vs 3)?
3. White-label offering details (pricing, features)?
4. Mobile app vs PWA only?

### Technical

1. Real-time updates: WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events?
2. NLU approach: Fine-tuned LLM vs rule-based?
3. Self-hosted vs cloud-only offering?
4. Model size limits (10MB? 50MB?)?

### Business

1. Pricing model: Freemium, open-core, enterprise-only paid?
2. Target market: Independent hotels only or chains too?
3. Go-to-market: Product Hunt, hotel associations, conferences?
4. Partnerships: Integrate with existing PMS or build full stack?
