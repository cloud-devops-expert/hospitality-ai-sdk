## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Architecture**: Traditional JavaScript → Timefold Escalation

```typescript
async function allocateRooms(bookings: Booking[], rooms: Room[]) {
  // Step 1: Try traditional
  const traditional = traditionalAllocate(bookings, rooms);

  // Step 2: Good enough?
  if (traditional.satisfactionRate >= 0.85) {
    return traditional; // 85% of cases, $0 cost
  }

  // Step 3: Feature flag enabled?
  if (!process.env.ENABLE_TIMEFOLD) {
    return traditional; // Fallback
  }

  // Step 4: Escalate to Timefold
  const timefold = await timefoldClient.solve(bookings, rooms);
  return timefold; // 15% of cases, $0.0002 cost
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ 85% handled at $0 cost (traditional)
- ✅ 15% complex cases get 95%+ satisfaction (Timefold)
- ✅ Blended cost: ~$1-3/month for typical hotel
- ✅ Feature flag control (disable Timefold if needed)
- ✅ Graceful degradation

**Blended Satisfaction**: ~87-90% (vs 85% traditional-only or 95% Timefold-only)

**Blended Cost**: ~$1-5/month (vs $0 traditional-only or $20/month Timefold-only)
