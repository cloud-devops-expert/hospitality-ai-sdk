## Technical Implementation Notes

### 1. Deployment Architectures

**On-Premise (Greengrass - 40% of market)**:
- Intel NUC ($400-$580 hardware)
- Full Python ML stack (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers)
- Local network only (greengrass.local)
- 95% operations on-premise, 5% cloud batch
- Best for: Medium/Large properties with IT staff

**Cloud (60% of market)**:
- AWS ECS/Fargate, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Instances
- Aurora Serverless (database)
- Multi-region redundancy
- Best for: Small properties (<50 rooms, no IT)

**Edge Devices**:
- Raspberry Pi 4/5 (8GB RAM)
- NVIDIA Jetson Nano/Orin Nano
- Intel Neural Compute Stick 2
- Mobile devices (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX)

### 2. Model Optimization

**Quantization**:
- FP32 → FP16 (2x speedup, 2x memory reduction)
- FP16 → INT8 (4x speedup, 4x memory reduction)
- Tools: ONNX Runtime, TensorRT, OpenVINO

**Pruning**:
- Structured pruning (remove entire neurons/channels)
- Unstructured pruning (remove individual weights)
- Target: 30-50% parameter reduction with <5% accuracy loss

**Knowledge Distillation**:
- Teacher model (large) → Student model (small)
- Example: BERT-large (340M) → DistilBERT (66M, 97% accuracy)
