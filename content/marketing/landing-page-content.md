## Problem Statement Section

### Title

**The $10k Problem: Why 80% of Hotels Can't Afford AI**

### Content (Bullet-Driven)

**Enterprise AI Solutions Cost a Fortune:**

- Revenue management systems (IDeaS, Duetto, Lighthouse): **$10k-50k/year**
- Guest experience platforms (TrustYou, Revinate): **$5k-30k/year**
- Operations automation (ALICE, HotelOps.AI): **$8k-25k/year**
- **Total AI stack: $25k-100k+/year** for a mid-size property

**This Prices Out 80% of Hotels:**

- Independent properties (1-50 rooms): **Can't justify the expense**
- Budget chains: **Need customization, not cookie-cutter SaaS**
- Regional operators: **Want self-hosted, not cloud dependency**
- Tech-savvy hoteliers: **Prefer ownable solutions over subscriptions**

**The Industry's Dirty Secret:**

- Enterprise AI uses expensive LLMs for **everything**, even simple tasks
- 70-80% of operations can be solved with **traditional algorithms** (free)
- Only 20-30% need actual machine learning
- **You're paying for AI you don't need**

**Market Gap:**

- **$90M market (2023) → $8B by 2033** (60% CAGR)
- **No open-source alternative exists**
- **No hybrid traditional+AI approach**
- **Zero privacy-first solutions**

## Solution Overview Section

### Title

**Hybrid AI: The Best of Both Worlds**

### Content (Strengthened Bullets)

**Our Philosophy: Cheapest Method That Works**

1. **Traditional Algorithms First (70-80% of cases)**
   - Rule-based pricing: $0 cost, <20ms response
   - Keyword sentiment: 71% accuracy, instant results
   - Allocation algorithms: 85%+ satisfaction, zero cloud calls
   - Constraint satisfaction: Complex scheduling solved locally

2. **Machine Learning Second (15-20% of cases)**
   - Logistic regression for no-shows: Better accuracy when needed
   - Time-series forecasting: Seasonal pattern detection
   - Browser-based transformers: Privacy-preserving sentiment
   - Local model inference: No API costs

3. **LLMs Last Resort (<5% of cases)**
   - Complex review responses only
   - Edge case sentiment analysis
   - Bring-your-own-API-key model
   - Pay-as-you-go pricing

**Result: 95% Accuracy at 1% of Enterprise Cost**
